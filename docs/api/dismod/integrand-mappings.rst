Dismod Integrand Mappings
-------------------------

There is a big of mapping that has to occur
between GBD measures and Dismod-AT integrands
and rates. Functions and dictionaries to aid in this
mapping are, for example:

.. autofunction:: cascade_at.dismod.integrand_mappings.integrand_to_gbd_measures

See `here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/cascade-at/blob/develop/src/cascade_at/dismod/integrand_mappings.py>`_
for more details.
