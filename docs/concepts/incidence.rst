S-Incidence and T-Incidence
---------------------------

We distinguish susceptible incidence rate from total incidence rate.
These are also called s-incidence and t-incidence.
Total incidence rate is the number of new observations of a disease
per person in the population, where both people with and without the
disease are counted. Because hazard rates are the probablity per unit time
of a transition *given that the transition has not happened,*
we wouldn't call t-incidence a hazard rate because it includes people
for whom the transition to the disease state has already happened.
Both, however, can be population rates.
