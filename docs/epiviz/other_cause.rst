Other-Cause Mortality
=====================

The IHME databases supply all-cause mortality, but Dismod-AT
uses other-cause mortality. It can impute what it needs to know
using all-cause mortality, but it is helpful to add other-cause
mortality not just as input data but as a constraint to the model.

*We use total mortality as other-cause mortality.*
The correct formulae to use are for "cause-deleted lifetables"
or "cause deletion."
