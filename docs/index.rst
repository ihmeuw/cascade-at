Cascade-AT
==========

Cascade-AT estimates incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates
for a single disease for every country or district in the world
from the sum of all available disease and death observations in all countries.

The main function of this page is to document the API, and to explain
some of the Dismod-AT concepts.

This documentation is meant for developers, not modelers. If you are a DisMod-AT
modeler, please see the internal documentation `here <https://scicomp-docs.ihme.washington.edu/dismod_at/current/>`_.
