        Runs the "traditional" dismod cascade. The traditional cascade
        as implemented here runs fit fixed all the way to the leaf nodes of
        the cascade to save time (rather than fit both).
        To get posterior to prior it uses the coefficient of variation
        to get the variance of the posterior that becomes the prior
        at the next level. At the leaf nodes to get final posteriors,
        it does sample asymptotic. If sample asymptotic fails due to bad
        constraints it does sample simulate instead.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model_version_id
            The model version ID
        split_sex
            Whether or not to split sex
        dag
            A location dag that specifies the structure of the cascade hierarchy
        n_sim
            The number of simulations to do to get uncertainty at the leaf nodes
        location_start
            Which location to start the cascade from (typically 1 = Global)
        sex
            Which sex to run the cascade for (if it's 3 = Both, then it will
            split sex, if it's 1 or 2, then it will only run it for that sex.
        skip_configure
            Use this option to skip the initial inputs pulling; should only
            be used in debugging cases by developers.
