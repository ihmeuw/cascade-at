""" This module defines general tools for building validators for messy
hierarchical parameter data. It provides a declarative API for creating form
validators. It tries to follow conventions from form validation systems in the
web application world since that is a very similar problem.

Example:
    Validators are defined as classes with attributes which correspond to the
    values they expect to receive. For example, consider this JSON blob:

    {"field_a": "10", "field_b": "22.4", "nested": {"field_c": "Some Text"}}

    A validator for that document would look like this:

    class NestedValidator(Form):
        field_c = SimpleTypeField(str)

    class BlobValidator(Form):
        field_a = SimpleTypeField(int)
        field_b = SimpleTypeField(int)
        nested = NestedValidator()

    And could be used as follows:

    >>> form = BlobValidator(json.loads(document))
    >>> form.validate_and_normalize()
    >>> form.field_a
    10
    >>> form.nested.field_c
    "Some Text"
