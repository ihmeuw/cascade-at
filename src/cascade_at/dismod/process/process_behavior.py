"""
Functions that interpret the return code, log, stdout and stderr
from Dismod-AT. These are rules that may change as Dismod-AT
output is edited.

 * Dismod-AT writes "end <command>" to the log just before exit(0).
   All other error messages are on stderr.

 * Many errors use error_exit, so that they write to the api log,
   print to stderr, and then exit(1).

 * The only non-zero exit code chosen by Dismod-AT is exit(1),
   which means other return codes are from signals.

 * Messages may come from cppad_mixed or from Ipopt, which can
   both print to stderr. The Ipopt messages are in
   ``./Ipopt/src/Interfaces/IpIpoptApplication.cpp``.
   Ipopt does have return codes, but they seem to be buried in CppAD.
