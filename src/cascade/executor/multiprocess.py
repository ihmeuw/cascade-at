    This runs processes and blocks until completion.
    The ``run_next`` function must have the signature

    .. py:function:: run_next(completed)

    where ``completed`` is a set of the IDs of tasks,
    which are likely location IDs, and it returns a
    dictionary from ID to a Namespace object with attributes
    ``memory`` and ``args``.

    Args:
        run_next (function): Returns tasks that can run. This function has
            to have semantics of a task graph, meaning it has to return
            results consistent with a fixed set of total tasks and
            one task depends on completion of others, not on any external
            behaviors. The task object this function returns has two
            attributes, ``args``, which is a list of arguments for ``fork``,
            and ``memory`` which is the maximum number of Gb this process
            could require.
        memory_limit (float): How much memory to use. This function doesn't
            check memory in the operating system. It checks against claims
            by the processes.
        sleep_duration (float): How long to wait if there's nothing to do.
