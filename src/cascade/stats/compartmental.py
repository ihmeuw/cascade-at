Compartmental Modeling Tools
----------------------------

These functions build theoretical distributions with which to understand
how Dismod-AT works, and how disease processes work.

1.  Specify a disease process by making simple Python functions that
    return disease rates as a function of time. You can specify a set
    of :math:`(\iota, \rho, \chi, \mu)`, or you can specify a set
    of :math:`(\iota, \rho, \chi, \omega)`. We'll call the former the
    total-mortality specification and the latter the other-mortality
    specification.

    There is a basic version of total mortality supplied for
    you in ``siler_default``.

2.  Given a set of pure functions, solve the differential equations
    in order to determine prevalence over time. For the total
    mortality specification, this means running::

        S, C, P = prevalence_solution(iota, rho, emr, total)

    The returned values are functions for susceptibles, with-condition,
    and prevalence of with-condition, :math:`P=C/(S+C)`.
    They are functions built by
    interpolating solutions to the core differential equation.
    For the other-mortality specification, this means running::

        S, C = dismod_solution(iota, rho, emr, omega)

    It can be helpful to define the total alive as a function::

        def lx(t):
            return S(t) + C(t)

    This is what we should use as a weighting function for computing
    integrands.

3.  Create a set of demographic intervals (regions of ages)
    over which to compute averaged values from the continuous rates::

        nx = (1/52) * np.array([1, 3, 52-3, 4*52, 5*52, 5*52], dtype=np.float)
        intervals = DemographicInterval(nx)
        observations, normalization = integrands_from_function(
            [incidence, emr, C],
            lx,
            intervals
            )

    The resulting list of observations is a set of arrays that then
    can go to Dismod-AT.

Differential Equations
----------------------

.. _dismod-at-equation:

DismodAT Differential Equation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These functions manipulate data for the compartmental model
that the differential equation describes. Using
:math:`S` as without this condition and alive, :math:`C` as with
condition, and :math:`R` as removed, or dead,

.. math::

    \frac{dS}{d\tau} = -\iota S + \rho C -\omega S

    \frac{dC}{d\tau} = \iota S - \rho C - (\omega + \chi) C

    \frac{dR}{d\tau} = \omega (S+C) + \chi C.

The time is cohort time, which we denote as :math:`\tau`.

These functions work with continuous functions. They are designed for
creating test data and analyzing interpolated data.

.. _prevalence-only:

Prevalence-Only Equation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The prevalence-only form of the ODE.
The full differential equation can be transformed into a space

.. math::

    P = \frac{C}{S+C}

    N = S + C.

to yield two differential equations, one for the prevalence and
one for the total mortality

.. math::

    P' = \iota (1-P) - \rho P - \chi (1-P) P

    N' = -\omega N - \chi C.

The :math:`N` variable doesn't appear in the first equation, so it is
independent and can be solved alone. Then the second equation is
equivalent to total mortality

.. math::

    N' = -\mu N

which indicates that :math:`\mu = \omega + \chi P`.
